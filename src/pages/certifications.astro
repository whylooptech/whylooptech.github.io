      As whyloop founder, I bring with me a wealth of real-life experience and
      expertise.

      Belows are some of the industry certifications I obtained over the past
      years. They will never be as valuable as real life experience. However,
      they attest that my skills have been vetted and are an irrefutable proof
      of my dedication to continuously learn, improve and deliver quality
      solutions at every steps of each client's DevOps journey.
